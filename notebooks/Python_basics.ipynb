    "> **Goal**: Learn the basics of the Python programming language and some of its core scientific libraries to interact with the notebooks. Note that **this is not** a general-purpose tutorial on scientific Python (although you will learn some concepts about scientific Python) but a tutorial with the basics to understand the codes in the notebooks. This tutorial also does not cover how to install Python on your system or how to install scientific packages.\n",

    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an _interpreted_, _high-level_, _general-purpose_, _multi-paradigm_ programming language. In a nutshell:\n",
    "- _Interpreted_ means that a sequence of instructions written by the programmer (\"the source code\") is read and executed by an interpreter without the need for compilation. This allows high productivity and interactivity that is advantageous for learning and for scientific analysis.\n",
    "- _High-level_ (of abstraction) means that the syntax of the language is designed to be easily understood by humans. Indeed, Python's core design philosophy emphasizes code readability over other aspects (human-readable code).\n",
    "- _General-purpose_ means that the language is not specifically aimed at scientific or numerical computing as for example Fortran, R, Matlab or Julia, even though it is very capable in this arena. The Python programming language is used indistinctly for Web or Software Development (e.g. Youtube, Reddit, Dropbox...), System Administration or games to name a few examples. \n",
    "- _Multi-paradigm_ means that the language supports different types of programming (declarative, functional, object-oriented, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the Python highlights are:\n",
    "- Completely free and open-source programming language.\n",
    "- Easy to learn (very gentle learning curve).\n",
    "- Widely adopted and with a good balance between cutting-edge and mature scientific libraries (i.e. core scientific libraries are based in Fortran and C routines tested in production for decades and less prone to errors)\n",
    "- Well-documented core scientific libraries,\n",
    "- The general-purpose nature makes Python a very versatile programming language beyond its use as a scientific tool (when someone writes code they always end up doing a few things that are not strictly data analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to read this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks or coding this tutorial is designed to be easy to understand. If you see a \"cell\" (a grey box with a chunk of code preceded by ``In`` plus a number between brackets) you are looking at the **input** or the Python code you enter in the Jupyter notebook. Everything that it is not enclosed in a grey box is either \"markdown text\" explaining things (e.g. what you are reading right now) or the **output** of the code that results of running the Python code enclosed in the cell immediately above (sometimes preceded by \"Out\")."

    "> **What it is?** A core package for scientific computing with Python. It enables the creation of numerical arrays and basic operations with arrays. See https://numpy.org/  \n",
    "> **What it is used for?** Numpy arrays are the standard representation for numerical data in Python. It enables efficient implementation of numerical computations in a high-level language and thus it is the way to go when doing numerical computation and analysing scientific data in Python. Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays (Harris et al. 2020). Many other data-science libraries for Python are built onto NumPy, including Pandas and SciPy (see below).\n"
