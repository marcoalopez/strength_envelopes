    "> **Goal**: Learn the basics of the Python programming language and some of its core scientific libraries to interact with the notebooks. Note that **this is not** a general-purpose tutorial on scientific Python (although you will learn some concepts about scientific Python) but a tutorial with the basics to understand the codes in the notebooks. Likewise, this tutorial does not cover how to install Python on your system or how to install specific scientific packages.\n",

    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an _interpreted_, _high-level_, _general-purpose_, _multi-paradigm_ programming language. In a nutshell:\n",
    "- _Interpreted_ means that a sequence of instructions written by the programmer (\"the source code\") is directly read and executed by an interpreter without the need for compilation. This allows for interactivity that is advantageous for learning, productivity and, ultimately, for scientific analysis.\n",
    "- _High-level_ (of abstraction) means that the syntax of the language is designed to be easily understood by humans. Indeed, Python's core design philosophy emphasizes code readability over other aspects (human-readable code).\n",
    "- _General-purpose_ means that the language is not specifically aimed at scientific or numerical computing as for example Fortran, R, Matlab or Julia, even though it is very capable in this arena. The Python programming language is used indistinctly for Web or Software Development (e.g. Youtube, Reddit, Dropbox...), System Administration or games to name a few examples. \n",
    "- _Multi-paradigm_ means that the language supports different types of programming (declarative, functional, object-oriented, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the Python highlights are:\n",
    "- Completely free and open-source programming language.\n",
    "- Easy to learn (very gentle learning curve).\n",
    "- Widely adopted and with a good balance between cutting-edge and mature scientific libraries (i.e. core scientific libraries are based in Fortran and C routines tested in production for decades and less prone to errors)\n",
    "- Well-documented core scientific libraries,\n",
    "- The general-purpose nature makes Python a very versatile programming language beyond its use as a scientific tool (when someone writes code they always end up doing a few things that are not strictly data analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to read this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks or coding this tutorial is designed to be easy to understand. If you see a \"cell\" (a grey box with a chunk of code preceded by ``In`` plus a number between brackets) you are looking at the **input** or the Python code you enter in the Jupyter notebook. Everything that is not enclosed in a grey box is either \"markdown text\" explaining things (e.g. what you are reading right now) or the **output** of the code that results from running the Python code enclosed in the cell immediately above (sometimes preceded by \"Out\")."

We have already used several built-in Python functions in this notebook, e.g. ``print()``, or functions belonging to different modules such as ``math.log()``. Python allow the user to define their own functions. For this, one needs to use the keyword ``def`` (meaning _define_) followed by the **name of the function**, a tuple which may be empty or contain one or multiple **arguments** (or formal parameters of the function), and a colon. Below this, goes the (indented) code block as follows\n",

The **positional** way, used in the example above ``min_value(2, 6)`` in which the position of the values within the tuple binds these and the arguments, x to 2 and y to 6 in this case. The **keyword argument** way, in which one bound the arguments names and the values ``min_value(x=2, y=6)`` to make it more explicit. Lastly, within the _function body_, a special Python statement named ``return`` need to be used, if not the output of the function will be ``None``. It is important to note that when you create a variable inside a function it is local and it only exists inside the scope of the function. This means that the user does not have to worry about the name of the variables used within the functions.\n",

Once the docstring is included within the function, it can be accessed using the command ``help()`` or the symbols ``?`` or ``??`` (you will probably also get a floating window showing this information as soon as you write the function on some IDES).

    "> **What it is?** A core package for scientific computing with Python. It enables the creation of n-dimensional numerical arrays and basic operations with arrays. See https://numpy.org/  \n",
    "> **What it is used for?** Numpy arrays are the standard representation for numerical data in Python. It enables efficient implementation of numerical computations in a high-level language and thus it is the way to go when doing numerical computation and analysing scientific data in Python. Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays ([Harris et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2)). Many other data-science libraries for Python are built onto NumPy, including Pandas and SciPy (see below).\n"
