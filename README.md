**Strength envelopes** is a pet project consisting of a series of free open-source multi-platform [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) aimed at building strength envelopes for the earth lithosphere. The notebooks are primarily intended for educational purposes (especially for hands-on courses) but are easily adaptable for more advanced modelling. The programming language used within the notebooks is [Python](https://www.python.org/) but does **not require previous knowledge of Python for its use**. All the notebooks are intended to be self-explanatory and with a smooth learning curve.

> **Disclaimer**: The project is currently under development. As a pet project, I develop it in my spare time and without specific deadlines.  Anyway, I hope to have most of the notebooks completed by 2021. Stay tuned.

## What is a Jupyter notebook and how to use it?

A Jupyter notebook is a document that supports mixing executable code ( **Ju**lia, **Pyt**hon, **R**, etc.), equations, visualizations, and narrative text, known as [literate computing](https://osf.io/h9gsd/). There are two main options to interact with a Jupyter notebook:

- Open the notebook locally on your computer, i.e. the notebook is stored on your hard disk. This is the fastest way to open and interact with a notebook and always have access to it. This requires, however, installing a Python distribution that includes Jupyter and several Python scientific libraries (see _Requirements & Python installation_ below) and download the notebooks. _A link to download all the notebooks available soon!_
- Open the notebook on remote servers as a web application (e.g. in [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)). The process of loading the notebook in this way can be quite slow, depending on its size, but it has the advantage of requiring nothing more than a browser and an internet connection. _More details on this modality coming soon!_

Lastly, there are exceptional Jupyter notebook video tutorials on the web (others not so much). For example, this one here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk

> **Are you an educator interested in using Jupyter notebooks as an educational tool?** Check the superb free book [Teaching and Learning with Jupyter](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/).

## Requirements & Python installation

A popular software distribution that includes the Jupyter notebook is the [Anaconda distribution (individual edition)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which is free, includes all the necessary scientific packages (> 5 GB disk space), and is ready to install on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Pick the installer with the newest version of Python and voila! Another option is to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which is a free minimal Python & Conda installation. If you are not sure whether you should install it, read [this](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/download.html#anaconda-or-miniconda). If you installed Miniconda, open the _Anaconda prompt_ and use the following command to install the minimum necessary dependencies to interact locally with the notebooks.

```shell
>>> conda install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib jupyter ipython jupyterlab 
```

Jupyter notebooks can be launched by open the Anaconda navigator (if you installed Anaconda) and launching the _Jupyter lab_ (preferred option) or the _Jupyter notebook_ or, more quickly, from the terminal (_Anaconda prompt_) typing ``jupyter lab`` or  ``jupyter notebook``. Then, you'll see the application opening in your browser. If you prefer a standalone application to interact with the notebooks you can install https://code.visualstudio.com/ and add the *Python* and *Jupyter* plug-ins.

## How to contribute to this project?

The GitHub website hosting the project provides several options (you will need a GitHub account, itâ€™s free!):

- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/discussions): This is a place to:
  - Ask questions you are wondering about.
  - Share ideas.
  - Engage with the developers (still just me).
- Open and [issue](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/issues): This is a place to track bugs or requests for specific features on the notebooks.
- Create a [pull request](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/pulls): You modified, corrected or added a feature to one of the notebooks and send it for one of the developers to review it and add it to the main page.

For a quick explanation see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OAwrcMlRw. Besides, if you want to contribute to the project, you might want to glimpse at the [code of conduct](https://github.com/marcoalopez/strength_envelopes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) (TLDR: be nice to others ðŸ˜‰).
